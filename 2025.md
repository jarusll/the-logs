My GPU died again. Fortunately it was under warranty so they should take care of it.

I really like Qt Designer, integrates cpp better than QML. I had issues interfacing cpp with QML. I need to figure out how to make qt daemons. 

I am really liking Niagara launcher. So simple and intuitive.

Someone said this recently that `You cannot really tell about things in present. You can only say how things are when you look back` and I've been thinking about it. 

I am watching `Swades` and I can't really stop myself from tearing up. I can't explain why. Maybe its because I've been out of touch with my culture. Maybe its because I haven't been close with my family. 

Playing `The Talos Principle` I do believe we are an iteration. And that I need to preserve what I learn. 

I am falling in love with forums. It's just cute what the AI just links up 10 years old solution to my problem. It makes me want to open up more, just shoot out the problem that I am having.

Someone smart said "The purpose of life is to lose ourselves in what we do".

He also said "We need to leave room for not understanding things"

I have been watching this Operating Systems course and it is the missing part to my understanding of things. I feel like I should've known this before because they are so fundamental.

I haven't had this joy for while. When you truly uncover things, most of the times it is the most obvious solution. For example allocating a memory also adds metadata header to the memory and so we don't have to specify how much to deallocate. Objetcts are stored as arrays of keys and values because arrays can be cached. 
Most of the courses felt like we are trying our best to hit caches so we wouldn't have to fetch memory which would be expensive.

It would be stupid to yapp about clean code without numbers. 

And that's the other part, getting benchmark numbers reliably. I recently parallelized ~8 calls to upstream and that reduced the response times from ~5 seconds to ~2 seconds. But given it's a lambda, I just cannot get reliable numbers to prove that it's actually ~2 seconds. The only thing I can show is telemetry numbers but given it's a lambda, you have cold starts.

I am bored from web development. I really want some challenge now.
