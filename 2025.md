My GPU died again. Fortunately it was under warranty so they should take care of it.

I really like Qt Designer, integrates cpp better than QML. I had issues interfacing cpp with QML.

I need to figure out how to make qt daemons.

Someone said this recently that `You cannot really tell about things in present. You can only say how things are when you look back` and I've been thinking about it. 

I am watching `Swades` and I can't really stop myself from tearing up. I can't explain why. Maybe its because I've been out of touch with my culture. Maybe its because I haven't been close with my family. 

Playing `The Talos Principle` I do believe we are an iteration. And that I need to preserve what I learn. 

I am falling in love with forums. It's just cute what the AI just links up 10 years old solution to my problem. It makes me want to open up more, just shoot out the problem that I am having.
