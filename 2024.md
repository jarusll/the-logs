Hello friend.

What has happened since the last time I wrote?
I got into reading for a while. Because I saw a tweet `You're always only 20 books away from you and the most cracked person you know in any field`.

So to ease into reading, I read `Lets Pretend This Never Happened` by `Jenny Lawson`. It was a very comfortable reading, so I could parse things without alot of my brain cycles.
I then read
- Animal Farm
- 1984
- Fahrenheit 451
- Catch 22

`Catch 22` has been, hands down the best book I've read. The out of order timeline makes it better.
I bet theres wayyyy too many links between things that I missed due to the jumping timelines and its still funny.

`Corrective Experiences` - Sounds cute.

I finally finished `The Little Schemer`. Its been about 5 years now since I started the book in my engineering canteen. I gave up on it because it
melted too much of my brain, thanks Y Combinator. I did understand it and I did finish it. I know how recursion is implemented now. It would take me a bit of brainfuck to
recall YC but I bet I can do it. I was kind of disappointed because it was nothing but patterns. Difficult to keep in head, but patterns nontheless.

After that, I tried to read `Godel, Escher and Bach` but I never got around it. Same with Dungeons & Dragons, did not hook well.
After that, I read
- The Metamorphosis
- Everything is Fuc*ed
- The Time Machine

For hands on, I did `The Art of Debugging` which taught me to use gdb in better ways.

I started reading `Around the world in 80 days`, did not hook well and I gave up. I don't feel like reading these days.

I am playing with OpenGL these days. If I can understand the fundamentals, I'll be hooked. I heavily use AI to understand things well with visual examples.


I feel a better way to use my pc/work laptop is just to control it using a single kbm. I found out about Deskflow(based on Synergy) has been a thing for a while.
So I just use my laptop along with my main PC.

Since all my gaming is on the Deck now, I dint really used my PC for a while. Long story short, now I remotely ssh into it using vscode and do almost all my development there.

Monsoon is depressing. I can't cycle, I can't go to places. The only good thing for me is I started carpooling with coworkers. So I am not driving alone for 4 hours and It offsets a cost a bit.

I have been getting lazy. I just have. Its not good for me mentally, I stagnate and I feel like shit. For now I am reading `Concurrency in Golang` by `Manning Pub`. I will also solve some `Leetcode` once in a while, buts its not consistent. I need competition.

Went on a long ride with my WagonR - `ECO` with a friend. It handled things well at 80kmph. The whole ride came upto 5Rupees/Km. I am going to track this for a while to come up with total running & maintainence cost for my car per month.

I got a 2TB external HDD for my offsite backup storage because Google was yelling at me due to storage shortage. And because it was the cheapest option in long term. So I have live storage & an offsite backup for now. I am yet to configure secondary storage(3rd copy) on my homeserver.

I downloaded all my data off google and that came out to be 907GB. I was shocked initially but it made sense when I looked at the amount of youtube videos. I am not backing up youtube vids until I compress them well.

I am having issues adding auto reload for `keydoggerrc` using `inotify` api. The API isn't behaving accordingly, Its not emitting any event for `IN_CLOSE_WRITE` which is `when file is closed after writing`. I have to use `IN_CLOSE` which means `when file is closed whether it was written or not`. But I am getting multiple events when I close just once. I am sleeping on the issue.

I went on a ride with `Haxor` to `National Park`. My original plan was to ride 60kms but `ARC` wasnt ready for long tour. Thanks to DAD who oiled the cycle and disc brakes were slipping.

Its not a good experience to restart `Keydogger` after updating expansions. I am going to add autoreload on file change.

Thanks to [Sync Graph](https://github.com/isturiz/sync-graph) I was able to sync my work contribs to my personal profile.

Hello friend, its been a while.

Why now?
Because I am in a good mood. I got a good [feedback](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40690990) on [`keydogger`](https://github.com/jarusll/keydogger), the text expansion program I wrote in C.
Also because I wanna sit down and reflect on the past 4 months.

What happened in the past 4 months?
I started working out. Its been 5 months and there has been decent progress. My weight remains the same but I lost body fat.

I use my foldie `Sol` to go to gym. And that has been all my cycling for a while. I absolutely adore the `Sol`. Its a 6 speed with single chain ring. I've been timing my upshifts well with pedalling so the upshifts feel very smooth. These days I am having fun working with the transmission.

Working with `keydogger`, I am really comfortable now with low level programming. I wanna have all the optimization tools in my belt. `KCachegrind` really helped me find bottlenecks but I would prefer flamegraphs more than the tabular format. I need to understand `KCachegrind` well.

I like the packaging status badge for linux packages on github. I wanna have something like that for `keydogger`. I'll test keydogger on different distros/archs. First distro is going to be `Alpine`.

`GNOME` Fedora broke steam streaming so I switched to `KDE` Fedora on `THE MACHINE`(My main pc). It was logical given `Valve` will keep improving `KDE` and all my programming work is done on my laptop.

`Syncthing` is magic. All of my devices are connected on it with `tailscale`. The homeserver pushes to cloud every 24 hours.

I realised you create samba shares for each directory.

AWS cloudformation is hard to debug. Change sets work on a high level but still the feedback time is big. I was trying to debug a nested stack but I got template size maxed out error. And that was the point I gave up.

[Create change set only without executing](https://curiousorbit.com/blog/cloudformation-changeset/)

I finished `Witcher 3`, I am at peace. I got Yennefer to come at Gerelt's place. Its sad that you could either be a dad or a lover, why not both? I wanted to see Ciri.

I took a break from gaming for a week and then I started playing `Ori and the Blind Forest`. The beginning scene almost made me cry.
The movement feels very responsive. I am playing it on easy difficulty because thats what I do now.

Everytime I look back on things I realize I could've done things better. Is it because I got better at it or I was rushing through things?
For me its more of rushing.
Everytime I go through my logs, I cringe. But it was me at some point. So I've accepted that I'll probably mess things up the first time.

Me, `Wolfie` and `Haxorlord` went on multiple cycle rides in January. We went to the `Pagoda` and `Dongri`. `Wolfie` needs to get comfortable on the road before he gets a motorbike. I thought about buying one but tbh cycles just work fine for me except for long rides which I dont see myself doing for a while.

Hello World, I was in `Malvan` with my bois `FLARE` and `Wolfsteindromon`.

I am very scared of the ocean. Every time the waves hit the shore, it roared and my heart grips. I felt running away from the beach. The high speed wind din't help as well.

`FLARE` did take us(`Wolfie`, `n7` and `me`) for a seafood lunch but it din't go well because I ate alot of fish bones and `n7` did not like the taste. I ate so many fish bones now I know how it tastes lol.

I tried सुरमयी(`Indo-Pacific King Mackerel`), पापलेट(`Silver Pomfret`) and बांगडा(`Indian Mackerel`). I liked the first because its so big theres just about 3 bones. `Pomfret` was tough but I got the hang of it and I am yet to develop taste for it. `Indian Mackerel` was the worst, It tastes too fishy, I tried it curry style, not fried.

The absolute best were the `Prawns`. `Prawns` + Rice with सार(Saar) was the best combo.

Also सोलकढी(`Solkadhi`). The meal feels incomplete without `Solkadhi`. Also कोकम(`Kokum`) sherbet, I am adding it to my comfort drinks.

We tried `Para-Sailing`, `JetSki` and `Scuba` and some more water sports. Jetski and Scuba was assisted and I would want it the same because the acceleration on the jetski was too much and so was the pressure on my ears during scuba. Saying that, next time I would wanna ride the jetski alone.
