Went on a long ride with my WagonR - `ECO` with a friend. It handled things well at 80kmph. The whole ride came upto 5Rupees/Km. I am going to track this for a while to come up with total running & maintainence cost for my car per month.

I got a 2TB external HDD for my offsite backup storage because Google was yelling at me due to storage shortage. And because it was the cheapest option in long term. So I have live storage & an offsite backup for now. I am yet to configure secondary storage(3rd copy) on my homeserver.

I downloaded all my data off google and that came out to be 907GB. I was shocked initially but it made sense when I looked at the amount of youtube videos. I am not backing up youtube vids until I compress them well.

I am having issues adding auto reload for `keydoggerrc` using `inotify` api. The API isn't behaving accordingly, Its not emitting any event for `IN_CLOSE_WRITE` which is `when file is closed after writing`. I have to use `IN_CLOSE` which means `when file is closed whether it was written or not`. But I am getting multiple events when I close just once. I am sleeping on the issue.

I went on a ride with `Haxor` to `National Park`. My original plan was to ride 60kms but `ARC` wasnt ready for long tour. Thanks to DAD who oiled the cycle and disc brakes were slipping.

Its not a good experience to restart `Keydogger` after updating expansions. I am going to add autoreload on file change.

Thanks to [Sync Graph](https://github.com/isturiz/sync-graph) I was able to sync my work contribs to my personal profile.

Hello friend, its been a while.

Why now?
Because I am in a good mood. I got a good [feedback](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40690990) on [`keydogger`](https://github.com/jarusll/keydogger), the text expansion program I wrote in C.
Also because I wanna sit down and reflect on the past 4 months.

What happened in the past 4 months?
I started working out. Its been 5 months and there has been decent progress. My weight remains the same but I lost body fat.

I use my foldie `Sol` to go to gym. And that has been all my cycling for a while. I absolutely adore the `Sol`. Its a 6 speed with single chain ring. I've been timing my upshifts well with pedalling so the upshifts feel very smooth. These days I am having fun working with the transmission.

Working with `keydogger`, I am really comfortable now with low level programming. I wanna have all the optimization tools in my belt. `KCachegrind` really helped me find bottlenecks but I would prefer flamegraphs more than the tabular format. I need to understand `KCachegrind` well.

I like the packaging status badge for linux packages on github. I wanna have something like that for `keydogger`. I'll test keydogger on different distros/archs. First distro is going to be `Alpine`.

`GNOME` Fedora broke steam streaming so I switched to `KDE` Fedora on `THE MACHINE`(My main pc). It was logical given `Valve` will keep improving `KDE` and all my programming work is done on my laptop.

`Syncthing` is magic. All of my devices are connected on it with `tailscale`. The homeserver pushes to cloud every 24 hours.

I realised you create samba shares for each directory.

AWS cloudformation is hard to debug. Change sets work on a high level but still the feedback time is big. I was trying to debug a nested stack but I got template size maxed out error. And that was the point I gave up.

I finished `Witcher 3`, I am at peace. I got Yennefer to come at Gerelt's place. Its sad that you could either be a dad or a lover, why not both? I wanted to see Ciri.

I took a break from gaming for a week and then I started playing `Ori and the Blind Forest`. The beginning scene almost made me cry.
The movement feels very responsive. I am playing it on easy difficulty because thats what I do now.

Everytime I look back on things I realize I could've done things better. Is it because I got better at it or I was rushing through things?
For me its more of rushing.
Everytime I go through my logs, I cringe. But it was me at some point. So I've accepted that I'll probably mess things up the first time.

Me, `Wolfie` and `Haxorlord` went on multiple cycle rides in January. We went to the `Pagoda` and `Dongri`. `Wolfie` needs to get comfortable on the road before he gets a motorbike. I thought about buying one but tbh cycles just work fine for me except for long rides which I dont see myself doing for a while.

Hello World, I was in `Malvan` with my bois `FLARE` and `Wolfsteindromon`.

I am very scared of the ocean. Every time the waves hit the shore, it roared and my heart grips. I felt running away from the beach. The high speed wind din't help as well.

`FLARE` did take us(`Wolfie`, `n7` and `me`) for a seafood lunch but it din't go well because I ate alot of fish bones and `n7` did not like the taste. I ate so many fish bones now I know how it tastes lol.

I tried सुरमयी(`Indo-Pacific King Mackerel`), पापलेट(`Silver Pomfret`) and बांगडा(`Indian Mackerel`). I liked the first because its so big theres just about 3 bones. `Pomfret` was tough but I got the hang of it and I am yet to develop taste for it. `Indian Mackerel` was the worst, It tastes too fishy, I tried it curry style, not fried.

The absolute best were the `Prawns`. `Prawns` + Rice with सार(Saar) was the best combo.

Also सोलकढी(`Solkadhi`). The meal feels incomplete without `Solkadhi`. Also कोकम(`Kokum`) sherbet, I am adding it to my comfort drinks.

We tried `Para-Sailing`, `JetSki` and `Scuba` and some more water sports. Jetski and Scuba was assisted and I would want it the same because the acceleration on the jetski was too much and so was the pressure on my ears during scuba. Saying that, next time I would wanna ride the jetski alone.
