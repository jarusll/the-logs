# 2023-10-15
I started reading `Beginning x64 Assembly Programming` by `Joe Van Hoey`. Its been fun playing around with `gdb` and getting to know the low level stuff. Prime example `syscalls`, `stack pointers`, `base pointers`. It fills missing info as a programmer about the stack, heap and more things. I am looking forward to `SIMD`. My goal out of this would be to have a clearer understanding of the hardware and hopefully this'll help me reason about things for optimization.

Me and my boi `FLARE` went to `Harishchandragadh` trek. `FLARE` sprained his ankle.

I am absolutely loving my GNOME setup. Now that I have alot of things going at once on my screen. I feel the need for more screenspace.

# 2022-10-01
Me and my boi `FLARE` went to Morbe Dam with SOL and ARC.
![FLARE and my cycles](/FLARE_MORBE.jpg)

I switched to GNOME Fedora on my system. I still use i3 on my work laptop.

I solved some [Neetcode](https://neetcode.io/) problems with ruby. Ruby is just a breeze to use. It feels like I am writing poetry. I am going to solve [Neetcode 150](https://neetcode.io/practice).
I feel guilty when I haven't solved some code challenges in a while.

Also Me and the bois made the perfect cake cover for `Xeon` & `Spicy`

Why? Why today?

I had a mental block for about a month. I hate boring, repetitive stuff. Stuff which doesn't bring a lot of value. I am out of it and thats why I am here.

I like tweaking, performance enhancements. Things which give metrics so you can improve things. I think thats why I am big into observability.

I hate monsoon. I do. I can't go out a lot. I think winter would be my favorite seasons of all. I can go out, I can stay in.

What was I working on? Boring stuff. But exciting as well. I tested if I can take my folding cycle in trains and it turns out I can except I have to buy luggage ticket and travel in luggage compartment so thats a bummer because I cant buy luggage tickets on my phone and luggage compartments are filthy.

These days I am travelling on my kick scooter. The day I bought it I had an icecream while riding my scooter, peak childhood moment. I want to experience mono rail. Even though they are not an efficient way to travel, they look cool.

I tried going to Juhu beach on my scooter and I waited for about 20 mins for the bus before I gave up. Buses are highly unreliable here. I think people use them just because they have no other option.

We did go to Alibaug and the bois surprised me with a cake, which was very nice of them.

What do I have planned for the coming months?
DSA, I want problem solving, I like it. I am an engineer. And me writing here would hopefully push me to solve problems.

I will also be implementing caching over the coming weeks. Nothing fancy for now, just client side caching but that would give me some insights with advanced caching systems.

I am selling all the junk I don't need.
- My split keyboard

  It dint work out for me. I use vim. I use the whole keyboard. A 60% keyboard would work for me. I cant get comfortable with or

- My Driving wheel

  Bad purchase given how less I play games these days. I have the PSP for that now

I am keeping a hard limit on the number of things I can own. Lets try that.

On 2nd September, I tried riding 100kms but my body gave up on about 65kms. I realized the position was very aggressive, I was leaning forward and it would numb my wrists. Also the seat was very uncomfortable since it doesn't have any cushion or suspension. I did 2 useful upgrades to my ARC(electric bike)

- Rear view mirror on right side
- Seat cushion

This will improve the ride quality for now. A better upgrade would be to raise the handlebar so I am in a vertical position which is very comfortable.

![My kick scooter](/scooter.jpg)
I am going to name my scooter WISP, inspired by the Dota character IO which was formerly named WISP. IO is a character which links with an ally and boosts them with healing(health) and mana(currency for spells). While it cant do a lot on its own but when paired with a skilled ally, it increases the chances of winning fights exponentially. And IO has an ability which can teleport itself and the linked ally anywhere and be back allowing both of them to pop in and out of fights. And I can pair my scooter with public transport which opens a lot of possibilities for travelling. So yes. WISP

I din't make it official but I named my foldie SOL. Its small, its cute, it folds and is modern. It also means the SUN and my name is Suraj which creates a strong connection between us.

Hello

Meet the goodest boy, Jack

Hello friend.

Why today? I finished playing this cute game called `A short hike`. Long story short, in the final part of the game you gracefully glide through the shimmering northern lights. It really resonated with my newfound freedom with cycling and I just had to stop and write it down. I recommend you try out this short cute game.

I finally joined gym and I have been working on myself. A lot of cardio and some of strength training.

I got infected with `n + 1` as well and I bought 2 more bikes. Hold on, let me explain.

I bought a `BTWIN Tilt 120`, a cute foldie bike for commuting.
![BTWIN Tilt 120](/Tilt120Marines.jpg)

I bought a `BOLT 28T MS`, a roadie for Dad. I don't use it, but its the lightest bike I ever rode.

`Me n the bois` will be going to Alibaug and its going to be my best birthday ever, not that I celebrate birthdays but it would be nice to spend time with them.

I have fully embraced the trucker life, sometimes I'll play `Snowrunner` with my gaming wheel and enjoy the slow truck ride. I realized driving slow is way better and soothing. I also have a trucker playlist now.

Peace out

# 2022-06-06
Hello friend, Its been a while.
What am I upto?
A lot of things.

Me and the bois went to Gorai beach, cycling all the way. Time well spent and I realized I love cycling.
So I bought a sweet ride and I am in love with it. I wanna go to places and take a lot of pics. I am looking for cycle buddies now because 20+km is risky.
![Schnell E Velo](/IMG_0140~2.jpg)

My 12 mini gave me battery life anxiety so I traded it with `Nothing` phone.

Me and the bois went to the arcade and movies and I tried the car sim and omg I am going to have a racing sim setup by end of this year with force feedback.

I am beginning to realize standardized is the way to go, prime example my keyboard. I bought a `crkbd` and I have been having a hard time building the muscle memory. The numbers and symbols layer fuck me up.
![CRKBD](/IMG_0102.jpg)

I have so much to do and so less time.

# 2022-04-12
Me and the bois started a minecraft server with `Create` mod. I am thinking about making a garden in front of my treehouse.

# 2022-04-11
I looked into caching for pipeline and brought down the runtime from about 7 minutes to 6 minutes.

# 2022-04-10
I optimized the build pipeline today from 16minutes to about 7minutes 30seconds by parallelizing build & test.

# 2022-04-09
Me and the bois played GO all day. Good day

# 2022-04-08
My domain expired in March and I had been pushing it to renew & update the diary. I got a really good deal on `suraj.lol`.

I found out `eslint` has `--cache` option and its cool. I also found out jest has a `--findRelatedTests` so you can run only affected tests on `pre-commit`, really cool.
I realized I was transforming `node_modules` and I should not because It fixed something when I was setting things up and I never came back to that option. I realized I dint need to. It saved almost 20s for me.
Also running jest tests in parallel halves the test runtime.

I have been binge watching `Curb Your Enthusiasm`. Love `Larry David`, his comedy is smooth.

I also have been watching a lot of `Louis CK`. I saw him on `Joe Rogan's` podcast and I came across `Tropic of Cancer` and I am going to check it out.

# 2022-03-01
The only thing stopping me from trying out other languages is setting up the env. Build systems should be easy to setup and use. I am trying out gradle this week, fingers crossed. The other thing stopping me is setting up tests, executing tests on a keypress for really quick feedback. Why not have a flat structure which I can query and browse as I want. Smalltalk did it really well.

# 2022-02-28
So I bought an Iphone mini 12.

# 2022-02-26
I did something which I've been meaning to do for a really long time, removing the bloat on my phone. I can't tell you how many times I've been annoyed to click on a link and it opens with the inbuilt browser. I removed everything, all of it.

I tried `swc` for jest and holy shit my test runtime went down from about `90s` to `20s`. I tried to integrate it for gatsby but it dint work out, neither did `esbuild`.

Why are all the phones big these days, they don't fit my small hands. I want a smaller phone. The only option for me is the iphone mini but I don't want ios and theres no decent android alternative. What happened to 5inch phones?

I can't limit the fps on my android. I want to limit it to like 24 fps and use it with greyscale filter. Battery life matters to me more than performance. I was looking at the Blackberry q10 listings and I am really tempted to buy it, but I know its not worth it.

I am done with multiplayer games. I just want to have some drinks and play singleplayer these days.

Whats wrong with talking about yourself all the time? You can be vulnerable and honest. You don't have to think about yourself highly all the time.

I woke up yesterday and my shoulder was fucked, I sprained my shoulder in sleep. I couldn't look to my right or sit or walk. This was my first shoulder sprain. Reminds me of the time my ears were popped and I was in pain for like a day.
# 2022-02-18
Day 3 with Github copilot, I am having too much fun with this. I am mostly using this to automate the boring stuff, JK I AM USING IT EVERYWHERE AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.

I am in love with testing.

I accidentally flashed my dick pic to the bois while trying to show something on my phone. It feels weird to say this but that was the night me and the bois connected.

My linux installation was all over the place, I had to do multiple actions to achieve anything. My preferred window manager is i3wm but I was on pop, using their tiling window manager which is good but just not fast enough. I dint want the animations and theres no absolute jumps. My dotfiles are git managed but not automatically symlinked. Using my linux install felt like a chore. So I decided today I am going to fix it. And I did, with `GNU stow`. I love `GNU stow`. It allows you to mirror 2 paths.

I am tinkering with basic concurrency with golang these days.

# 2022-02-03
Been helping my co workers, makes me feel good. I want the people around me better so I learn from them.

I am a baller for life now. Ever since I started using my trackball vertically, I can't stop thinking about using my keyboard tented.

I am thinking more these days. I am becoming me now, crystallizing.

Me and the bois went trekking at Prabalgad Fort a while ago, it went as expected. I was defeated, mentally & physically. It was a difficult expedition but we just had to keep moving forward. I am glad I did it and will be up again anyday.
*मी मराठा*

I have been spearheading React testing these days. I will be comfortable testing anything now.

# 2022-01-21
I realized a lot of things didn't make sense to me because I wasn't emotionally mature enough.

# 2022-01-13
I've been listening to a lot of alt/rock, another genre that I like.

# 2022-01-12
BALLS BALLS BALLS BALLS BALLS BALLS BALLS BALLS BALLS!!!!!

I am a baller now.

I rubbed balls on my face today.

I bought a trackball for ergonomics and will switch to it for work.

# 2022-12-31
Spent my 31st playing Hunt: Showdown with the bois 9+ hours.

Update on Alpakka controller, the prints were misaligned so the front & back casing are being reprinted. I should have it ready in 2-3 weeks.

# 2022-12-26
I lost my grandpa today. I wasn't really sad until I saw him burn and the tears rolled, it was a short burst of emotions. It was negative but not net negative.

# 2022-12-24
Went out overnight stargazing. It was a good experience although it would have been wayyyy cooler if we cooked noodles and tea on the portable stove.
Long story short, its confirmed that I do snore and everyone knows.
Here are some pics.

# 2022-12-21
Today I tried something new, connected my bluetooth keyboard to both my pc and laptop and I am not going back. I'll use my old keyboard as macroboard. I also started using my speaker which was sitting around for about a year just because I use my iem or headphone on pc.

Update on the ahk macro thingy, Luamacros seems inadequate for my usage. I want modifiers in it and I'll have to look if luamacros can do that.
I have a reason to learn simple video editing, I've started to stream on youtube.

I have been feeling the itch to play management games, I'll try the new dwarf fortress soon. I don't have the skill or time for competitive games and I want to move away from them.

I came across [Firestarter](https://open.spotify.com/track/67mbvNgp8qmt4GHpZgN7Ze?si=c387bdf4104c4048) and I can't really describe how It makes me feel but I like it. Also I've been listening a lot to [CountryStar420](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2f8tYvk0zQhEjUJQ9sStyB?si=LVzgQwpmRoKm0XMXE6RbeA).

Next year mid I'll buy a height adjustable desk for the space and my health, I feel I get more done while standing just because I am walking, I am thinking, I am not stuck in a place.

This year has been big for me, I've grown a lot and if I could list them down it'd be
- The biggest being able to communicate with people
- Gyro, can't thank enough the whole gyro gaming community, especially [Jibb Smart](https://www.jibbsmart.com/), I prefer my controller now over kbm
- Buzzcut, I am permanent buzz cut now or bald

Over and out.

# 2022-12-11
I have found my new drug, autohotkey. I am building a macro keyboard with it along with luamacros.

The prints came in and its looking cute. I am waiting for other parts to arrive, this'll be my 2022's gift for myself.

# 2022-12-07

I have to admit, I have been coming home all happy and bubbly. When I am away I am thinking about it. I think I am in love, IN LOVE WITH GYRO!!!! AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH

Also, I AM BUILDING THE ALPAKKA CONTROLLER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

# 2022-11-30

I tried out acceleration with gyro and it's not for me. I have been streaming videos on YouTube so I can get better with gyro aiming. My videos are not a good example for gyro gaming and I'll update there soon.

Me and the bois have been playing Hunt: Showdown and we've had some good moments and some really scuffed moments. I won't stop gaming even when I am older with responsibilities.

I saw the [Alpakka](https://inputlabs.io/devices/alpakka) controller and I am excited for it. I am more excited for the one handed controller and glad they are coming up with more options for gyro gaming.

I ordered Joycons and I am smoothing things out. I really want to try out two handed gaming.

I am in a comfortable position right now and can take a breather.

# 2022-11-20
I finished playing *Titanfall 2* and it was one of the best games. Another good "Machines with beings" game.

I am absolutely obsessed with gyro controls. I am playing every game with gyro. I will soon be writing about gyro after I have enough experience with it.

I saw a lot of joycons gyro gaming videos and I thought about trying out 2 handed as well except wiimote isn't good and so are the joycons. I will sleep on this decision for a while. If I really want to try 2 handed gaming I'll buy it in 2-3 months.

I started uploading gyro youtube on videos. This way I get to try out new games and test out gyro so I refine my control scheme everytime I try something new.

# 2022-11-11
Xeon's monitor borked so we went shopping last saturday. He bought a monitor and I bought a Hyper 212 for my thermals and FLARE bought USB Switch which is cool. I will buy switches when I have proper remote work setup, not a lot of space with dual monitors and mic.
The cooler took down the temps by 15 degrees.

![Image](/1dde633bf72c1e2a1d6523d27c0bc309.jpg)
*Bless your eyes*(Sorry for the dust)

I have been playing games with gyro + flick stick for the past few days and I've been having an absolute blast.
I want this control scheme bad in every game with aim. I am very bad at aiming but this enables better aiming with controller for me since I prefer controller.
Huge thanks to [JibbSmart](https://www.youtube.com/c/GyroGamingJS). If you are a controller player or a tinkerer I recommend you check out [GyroWiki](http://gyrowiki.jibbsmart.com/). I will be uploading my key profiles there and on my site.

I am at a phase in life where I do feel responsibilities and need to think about future.

Me and FLARE played *theHunter: Call of the Wild*. We held *First to 2 kills* competition and I let him win.

Daily updates are not possible so I am going to maintain it weekly. Shorter 1 point updates in Obsidian and update on weekends.

I noticed I perform better with peers who I can look upto. Also when I have more freedom. Also that I like refactoring. Its mostly for making it terser and my satisfaction. Its been a good week and I'll play some Deep rock galactic, ofc with gyro + flick stick.

# 2022-10-03
Its been a while. I haven't booted up linux in a while. My PC is just for gaming these days.

I spent the Diwali vacation with the bois. Meetup and games, the best time ever with the bois.

I have been experiencing mini stutter on my PC and it took a month to realize its signal interference with my mouse dongle.

I had to replace the ribbon PCB on my dualshock 4 to fix a dead button. I have a decent screwdriver for now but I plan to buy a good screwdriver in future.

I also bought case fans which fixed the thermals.

# 2022-10-17

Read about snowpack, parcel & esbuild. Snowpack was a good idea, it could be integrated in existing bundlers. Will setup a POC & test webpack, rollup, esbuild & parcel.

Played God of War at 1080 Ultra. It felt rich.

I read Harry Potter till Goblet of fire about 2 years ago, binge watched the whole movie series past 3 days. I am beginning to realize I like Heroic Fantasy.

I won't be able to update here frequently with a lot of things going.

I have been absolutely deep diving into bundlers with webpack and these 2 weeks I'll look into snowpack & esbuild. I am very excited about esbuild.

![Image](/f6ff3a72bcfa25614c12907089ce908e.jpg)

Bought a dualshock 4, mostly for gyro and flick stick. Not the best but it is fun and also I needed a controller.

Yes I did try Parsec and it was good. There was a noticeable latency but I play cinematic so it was good. Although I really don't have any reason to play on parsec since I am always around my PC.

Me and the bois are having an absolute blast with Overwatch 2 these days. Short 10 mins matches and pretty fun. This might become our go to game. My favorite character is Junkrat because I feel like I have that energy when I am in my zone.

Saw her again but she dint let me pet her. It'll take some time.

I had my cpu configured wrong all this time. PBO enabled screws up everything and it boosts to 4.4ghz but with very bad thermals at 95C and so does eco mode. Keeping PBO at auto keeps things normal and it gets around 4.1ghz but with very good thermals at 80+-2C. This is with just 1 exhaust fan. Getting more fans will fix things.

I had some really good lassi today, not so sweet and came with cream on top. Buttery smooth and some rubbery texture contrasted really good with the plain lassi. I still miss MM's lassi, it's not the same anymore with that prepackaged shit.

I saw them again ahahahaha, hopefully they'll let me pet them after a while.

[Jun](https://arjun.lol) said parsec is black magic and I can confirm it is. I have tried
- Steam Link(with 1030).
  - I do understand 1030 did not have any encoder but parsec is so good I won't even bother trying steam link with my 6700xt
- Rainway
- Amd Link
  - I like Amd link for having remote access.

and a couple of other less known in home streaming solutions and parsec is the absolute best. I have always wanted to play games on my phone. I even had a controller with mount when I used to rock my 1030. I'll soon be buying a decent controller to stream games on my phone.

Looks like there's no easy way to have on screen controls with parsec and I'll have to wait until I buy a controller.

# 2022-09-25

Played Death stranding on 4k downscaled to 1080 and it was absolute crisp. My 6700xt was able to handle it well given my only requirements were ultra/high settings with FSR and stable 60fps. I do admit 4k was overkill, I'll just downscale from 1440p.

# 2022-09-24

I have been having an absolute blast with my new GPU. There was an overheating issue which I resolved with a new thermal paste. I will resolve the heating with a couple of case fans.

I can really get lost into webpack. I do understand that it's overengineered and I feared it before but now that I am comfortable with it, I spent hours last night optimizing a build. I think i am big into observability.

Also, [Jun](https://arjun.lol/), good guy, talks a lot about optimization. Check him out.

# 2022-09-09

Spent the day taking readings with webpack bundle analyzer.

# 2022-09-08

Given how much I've been dealing with metrics these days I might read about it soon.

# 2022-09-07

Making things is easy, maintaining isn't.

I'll soon be deep diving webpack now that I've got a knack for diagnostics. Also I am dying to try out golang's buffered channels.

I seem to have the ability to make big changes on a codebase by observability.

# 2022-09-06

Turns out I like profiling. Getting frame graphs up and looking at performance bottlenecks, i like it.

Been using obsidian a lot at work.

Good day

# 2022-09-05

I discovered buffered channels in go and it blew my mind away. This just now feels like factorio.

> Paper has more patience than people - *Anne Frank*

I like it when the trains at full speed when I am reading on my Kindle.

# 2022-09-04

Played a lot of dota, I experimented with playing support with IO and it was good.

I read about concurrency.

# 2022-09-03

Started reading `Nonsequential and Distributed Programming with Go`

I experimented with a lot of dota characters. Skywraith is a good one. I'll soon be trying out OmniKnight.

Played Valhiem & Dota with FLARE. He has made quite some upgrades to the main base.

![](/Bonemass.jpeg)
*Bonemass beat the fuck outta us, fortunately we managed to get rid of him* - FLARE

# 2022-09-02

Looked into go's concurrency patterns.

# 2022-09-01

Setup go env and play around some boilerplate.

# 2022-08-31

Went to FLARE's place. It was nice. Good shit.

# 2022-08-30

Looked into Go's concurrency. I am going to fuck around concurrency soon.

# 2022-08-29

My poor 1030 struggles bad with Death stranding. A couple of npcs and it dips below 10fps even though I am playing on 720 low settings. I'll have to wait until I can experience it better. I'll soon buy a GPU.

# 2022-08-28

I'll need to get familiar with golang's env.

Started playing `Death Stranding`. I played about an hour and I think this is my type of game given its atmospheric and visually pleasing. I am playing on easy since I want story and not combat.

# 2022-08-27

I am very relieved when the debugger is up. Messing around with go and ctags, let's hope I get the mini MVP up by tomorrow.

# 2022-08-26

Refactoring support of Webstorm is absolute insane.

Tried playing Bioshock. Feels like  "Extreme gone wrong". But after a while it feels repetitive that's why I prefer playing on easy mode because I like story more than combat. Maybe Bioshock isn't for me.

# 2022-08-25

I love debugging. Its sad that it isn't mainstream.

`ctags` is fun as well. It would be very nice if I could catalogue and query the tags.

# 2022-08-24

They launched a new kind of train. Pretty retro.
![New train](https://statictoiimg.com/photo/71916296.cms?imgsize=63246)

I like a codebase where everything is said only once. I like it even more if it's terse.

Had an insane Dota match where the winning favour kept toggling between each team. We won at 4th swing. I was playing Oracle and I saved my Sven with my ultimate and I saved total 5 deaths with my ultimate. Good match.

# 2022-08-23

Deep dived GraphQL. My plan to being a good developer is to read lot of code and that's why I love code browsing.

I finished reading *The Defining Decade*, I want something else to read now.

I had too many eggs yesterday so I can't eat any this week. I wish *methi* was available all year, i love greens.

I am going to read [The diary of a young girl](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48855.The_Diary_of_a_Young_Girl)

# 2022-08-22

I LOVE TRAINS!!!!! AHAHAHAHAHAHAH

I have decided to use golang for the next thing but I haven't started with it. I will soon. Go is a very good choice because I want to dabble with concurrency and parallelism.

I want to live a life where I can be creative whether it be games or art or programming.

Almost halfway through [The Defining Decade](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40603783-the-defining-decade).

Looked up React profiling and testing. Profiling is something I want to get into, get up some flamegraphs up and gain insights into performance.

The train journey wasn't bad. I realized I never really got to see Mumbai. I like it when everythings just lively.

# 2022-08-21

Played Valheim with FLARE. We've made quite progress. Unfortunately the screenshots he sent me are nota lot . I'll post when I have many.

I also played GO with FLARE and Spicy. I am bad at FPS and I like when they play casual with me.

# 2022-08-20

These two days are going to be my guilt free gaming days.

# 2022-08-19

Things are going to change. I feel like I am in a new stage of life(probably).
Dug up my Kindle and started reading [Imposter Syndrome](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55338924-impostor-syndrome)

# 2022-08-18

What a day. Its a good day.
I rewatched some of *The Eric Andre show*. I am glad the show is still going. Sometimes I don't understand it but I like what I see.
Maybe I like bizzare stuff.

##### Some of the places I want to be
- [Metro Universe](https://metrovideogame.fandom.com/wiki/Metro_Wiki) shoulder to shoulder with comrade Artyom.
- [Valheim Universe](https://valheim.fandom.com/wiki/Valheim_Wiki) with FLARE raiding dungeons. I wish Valhiem had building on ships so we wouldn't have to leave ships.

# 2022-08-17

Back to back action. I was occupied with personal stuff today.

# 2022-08-16

Personal day. I solved some rustlings.

Besan ladoos are absolute gold.

# 2022-08-15

I am in love with Russian music videos. Some of them are absolutely out of this world. I love it.
Some of the ones which I've been listening are
- [Ленинград — ЗОЖ](https://youtu.be/DgdP5U28jHc)

I had to hunt this down. I listened to this in one of Bald and Bankrupt's videos.
- [Май](https://open.spotify.com/track/60gcgHGUfqg4dAMwtNitK7?si=7c95f295985848db)

I am past borrow and ownership in rust. I made some progress with rustlings.

I am deep diving `ctags` because I love code browsing and also for a thing.

Setup finger on vps but for some reason it's not picking up .plan file. I'll look into it but it's not high priority.

# 2022-08-14

I played valorant and had some sweets.
I got started with rustlings and I am stuck on borrowing and ownership.
Good day.

# 2022-08-13
The remaining problem from yesterday, done. I m starting to like gnome. I am not as fast as I am on i3wm but the goodies it comes with make up for it. Also my wisdom tooth is emerging so that's a pain in the ass. I can barely eat anything these days. I had chocolate chips. Tomorrows my birthday, I am going to have Cadbury and play games.

Good day.

# 2022-08-12

I did something cursed today, mixed Mayo and ketchup for chipdip.

Solved and hosted one problem. I'll do the other one tomorrow.

Shes a survivor. I still remember the day she was born. Shes the only one who made it out of 3. She has grown so big I barely recognized her when she came upto my desk one day and I was scared for my kitten. That was my `Sintel` moment. Fortunately shes cool with other cats. I wish she came to my place more. I also got to pet my other cat(baby cat) yesterday and it looks like she has learnt the way of kitties. She'll survive. I was glad she recognized me(atleast that's what I think). It was a good day.

# 2022-08-11

I solved a problem and half today. Pretty easy.

# 2022-08-10

Today I learned how to `finger` unix. I will probably have a banner on my diary page about how to finger my site. If you are reading this please lookup finger unix command.

# 2022-08-09

# 2022-08-08

Learnt about Tauri, the gui framework. I am loving it. Platform independent UI with rust backend, sold. The only reason I haven't got into rust is the technical details.

# 2022-08-07

Played GTA and Valheim with FLARE.

# 2022-08-06

My health is improving and I am almost back up.
I played some GTA with the bois.

# 2022-08-05
# 2022-08-04
# 2022-08-03
# 2022-08-02

Slept all day, played some valorant.

# 2022-08-01

My health hasn't been in a good shape and I am taking a break until I am back up.

# 2022-07-31

Wrote a wrapper for making API calls in Vala.
It will take a month for the prototype of `Reflections`.
Riced my Gnome system with some goodies.
UX is something I never noticed because I am used to tiling window managers. But Gnome has one of the most intuitive GUI UX.

# 2022-07-30

Finally switched to Opensuse so I can have a proper workstation experience.
I will install a tiling window utility just because I'll be fast but I don't mind using the mouse now.

# 2022-07-29

I can barely call it a diary now with these 1 line updates. I have been busy with other things.
I have started using Obsidian for note taking and I spend most of my time there. It would be nice if I can push my updates from there.
I used to use GitJournal on Android but this file is too big to load and slows down badly.

Either I'll come up with something to update frequently or I'll just rename this to `Logs`.

# 2022-07-28

Looked into building GTK apps. Vala seems to be the most intuitive for me with better documentation and syntax. Things are hacky with other languages.
I want to build one good gtk app, my gtk magnum opus.

# 2022-07-27

Spent the day solving a problem. Fingers crossed. Wrote about Discoverability in codebase. Turns out Static analysis and discoverability are almost same.
FLARE sent all the screenshots of valheim, will post it soon.

# 2022-07-26

I might take over as maintainer of vscode-snippets extension.

# 2022-07-25

Game night. FLARE streamed Stray. It was the cutest game ever and I almost cried at the end.
I am totally going to replay it.

# 2022-07-24

Setup Obsidian along with syncthing to make my life easier with notetaking.

# 2022-07-23

Went out with the bois. Good day.
I am polishing the lazy loading in my extension. I am absolutely having a great time exploring codebases. Right now while testing my extension I have vscode repo on and sometimes I'll get distracted and explore its classes. I like when they are commented and I know whats its purpose.

# 2022-07-22

I am prototyping lazy loading for my extension.

# 2022-07-21

I added type filtering in my extension.

![ClassBrowser in Action](https://rawgithubusercontent.com/jarusll/vscode-class-browser/master/extension/media/showcase.gif)

# 2022-07-20

Spent the day tinkering with visual IDEs. I don't think I can improve anything in that domain.

# 2022-07-19

Personal Day.

# 2022-07-18

I DID IT!!!!!! I published my first extension. I actually wanted to make a smalltalk like class browser but then I would have to make an outline view and VSCode's outline view is just the best. I cannot make it any better so my extension just compliments it. Outline view for a file and class browser for global search(Class/Interface/Structs).

I'll add the option to choose which types to filter out. But this looks good for an mvp.

Heres a screenshot.

![Image](/classbrowser.png)

Top right is class browser and bottom right is outline view.

I might change the name given its not a class browser.

*Everything is just an abstraction away.* - Suraj Yadav

*The less code I look at, the better* - Zen Suraj Yadav

Alright I used the extension for a while and here are somethings that I can improve.
- Focus directly on input with a shortcut.
- Navigate using arrow keys.
- When I click open a file, it should automatically focus on outline view with it being expanded.

I feel like this would push me to write better code since I won't be looking at it much.

Good day, night

# 2022-07-17

The prototype of ClassBrowser vscode extension is ready. I ll add features incrementally and clean up the code.

# 2022-07-16

Where have I been? I've been working on my game. And for the past few days I've been working all night. My vps is broken and I haven't had time to fix it.

I have the prototype ready. Tomorrow I'll add the Ability/Effect matrix.

I have learnt soooo much working on this game. I am having the absolute best time with OO right now. Everything is just message passing. Fire & forget.
The Class/Object browser feature is just cherry on top. I want this functionality in every IDE.

Good day

# 2022-07-15

Worked late night & played Valheim with FLARE

# 2022-07-14

Worked late night & played Valheim with FLARE

# 2022-07-13

Made artworks for the cards and simplified the mechanics.

# 2022-07-12
Refined the gameplay loop.

# 2022-07-11

Basic gameplay loop ready. Should be able to have a poc by tomorrow. Working at night is peaceful but it fucks up my sleep.

# 2022-07-10

Finally got the UI working. The Deck is ready. Tomorrows plan is to implement the Abilities & gameloop.

I have been playing Valhiem with Wolfie & FLARE. My VPS has been slow for some reason, I'll investigate later on.

# 2022-07-09

Made some prototypes in Godot.

I will be using Entity Component System for my game. I made the interaction matrix and will fine tune it tomorrow.


# 2022-07-09

Spent the day testing out game engines. It went so bad that I thought I might have to use Java swing to make my game but thanks to Godot.

# 2022-07-08

Java browsing perspective in Eclipse, just what I was looking for. Installed vim keybinds and now just have to get comfortable with eclipse keybinds.

*But I am bursting with curiosity* - Anne, Anne With An E

Setup the absolute(maybe) perfect environment for java in Eclipse, almost close to smalltalk with Java browsing perspective. The scrapbook page is one of the best features.


# 2022-07-07

Looked at Java Reflections library. Read about Visitor and Decorator pattern. This is just too good. I feel like one man army designing things.


# 2022-07-06

Personal day.

I might have a confirmation on a prototype by end of this week.

# 2022-07-05

Hectic day today and an emotional ride. Fingers crossed.

Design patterns yummy.

One of my criticism is that I over engineer stuff. I need to think about this.


# 2022-07-04

I tried out java today and it was nice but its missing a good IDE.

*One person's pattern can be another person's primitive building block* - Design Patterns, Elements of Reusable Object Oriented Software

I have an itch for GUI programming these days.
I am starting to like java for determinism. I looked into reflection in java. I have some ideas but I'll wait until I get comfortable with java.

I started reading "Design Patterns, Elements of Reusable Object Oriented Software".


# 2022-07-03

If I am working in a team, I'd definitely prefer OOP. I can understand Java's appeal which is why I've decided for the nth time I'll setup java env and give it a go.

Using OOP for logic with React was pretty nice logically but pain to integrate. I'll see if there's a better way to integrate OOP with react. No, not class components. I had to recreate the object for reactivity.

I remember the scene from Dota where Invoker is in a never ending library and books float mid air and pages turn by his will. I want that kind of power. Just float around and read things all day.

*The council of kitties have blessed my rig*


# 2022-07-02

When I am writing OO, I should be able to jump fast between classes & methods and its better if I am able to view just 1 method at a time. Theres a saying in OO community(I've heard) that if you ask what a method does, the answer will be "I don't know". Just because its not your responsibility but of the class implementing it.

I've been playing Valorant I am absolutely loving it. I like abilities more than gunplay. These days I am playing Initiators and I like that fact that I hunt/mark down enemies. My aim isn't good but I like abilities.

My cat is a monster. Just killed a baby mouse and is playing with his body.

I just finished a problem and used pure OO and TDD. This was good. I learnt a lot.

Correction, there's 3 of them. The third just walked in today and latched on mommy cat.

![Image](/33cd1c3825a05befa522fabbbf85a8fa.jpg)


# 2022-07-01

I am working on a problem. React does have its quirk. I have my business logic in pure OO and view in pure functional. Writing OO code makes me miss smalltalk.


# 2022-06-30

Personal day.

Oracle terminated the Minecraft server account without any clarification.

I feel like writing short stories, inanimate objects becoming self aware and backstories.


# 2022-06-29

I wrote something and I am proud of it.


Good day

# 2022-06-28

Personal day.

The X dilemma, I could either believe an abstraction and build upon it or see for myself and build my own abstractions. With the former I won't get to the root and the latter will eat up my time. I, like always like a good balance.


# 2022-06-27

I have specs for commands. I still need figure out how the whole system will communicate.


# 2022-06-26

I have a mini plan and I am going to commit to it.
I can't stress how good TDD & tests as specs are.

I have a mini plan and I will be working on it this week.
I have been trying to build a prototype and I was lost with details.
Unit tests give clarity & confidence.


# 2022-06-25

I've been observing my kittens and I think this is what goes in their tiny kitten heads.
- I am cute
- DON'T TOUCH ME
- Scritches, oh yeah
- I wonder what this does *proceeds to paw it*, IT MOVES AHAHAHAHAH
- I am water
- *stretch and yawn and instant sleep*

![Image](/d6deef424d00dcad51d02c9ebac642ed.jpg)

# 2022-06-24

Spent the day thinking about new ideas. The bar that I've set for myself is to build something which I will use.
I did narrow down some good ones and I'll start on it once I've a mini plan.

One of the ideas is smalltalk inspired IDE for javascript. I looked into Reflection API. If Reflection & Proxy solve my problems then I might commit to this.


Night

# 2022-06-23

Decoupled grammars.

![Image](/3464523de4398584e81e40ae71bb2196.jpg)

The first stable version of the compiler is out. I will add features incrementally. This will be my test bed for lambda calculus.


Good day, night.

# 2022-06-22

Need to think about priorities. Got sidetracked for 2 days.
Back on my compiler.

![Image](/7db81936eb12efa72acea8427dd31d11.jpg)
*They did come, ahahahah*

Should be able to cleanup the compiler tomorrow.


Good day, night.

# 2022-06-21

*Rabbits are machines for turning grass into rabbits* - Someone on hackernews

I realized I could write a lot of notes with flashcards. Need to find a good flashcard android app. Bonus if it supports import/export so I can configure it with syncthing.


![Image](/98eb4943262815447564da00f41d87ae.jpg)
*Passing by kitties. I offered them food but they din't stay*

*Omgomgomg they came back, ahahahahahahah*

![Image](/612c79bf994e16a6bde6b17b027a7047.jpg)
*Put out some milk in box and they fell for it, ez scam*

They went away again. I wish they come back tomorrow.

Solved some good problems today.

Night

# 2022-06-20

Busy with working on a problem.

I don't need git on my phone, I can just setup Syncthing and let the vps handle git commits. I just need my files synced across devices. I'll soon host Syncthing.

Let's see if I can serve my org-roam notes with hugo.

Good day, night

# 2022-06-19

Played some Apex and Dota after a long time.

I am thinking about new ideas, solely for amusement.

Setup org-roam and it's portable so I can use it on multiple devices. I will lookup ways to browse org files on Android.

Tomorrow I will push `Application`.

Good day, night

# 2022-06-18

Went down the rabbit hole of compressing the assets. Its done and I'll integrate it soon.

Will gzip & minify my assets soon.

Pushed `Abstractions`.

Added awesome. Need to think about how I will organize.

Had a meaningful conversation about work culture today.

Metro stream at night by Flare, Yayy

# 2022-06-17

The arm instance on Oracle has been running really well. Infact we hosted a full fat modded Minecraft server on it and its been able to handle it like a pro.
I hosted a service on it last night and I have been thinking about switching to arm fully. I think I will be able to switch well given that I dockerize everything. Let me think about this.

Someone has already made a better playground for nearley So I can move on to something else. Or I could improve it, I'll think about it. Time for some dog fooding. I realized I don't need backend for this So I could just make a Client side rendered webapp.

One of the things I want to build with is Codemirror/Monaco. Just because I do like editors and use editors I want to build using one.

Pushed part 2 `Grammar & Primitive Operations`. Next will be `Abstraction` and `Application`

# 2022-06-16

Made a webapp for prototyping with nearley. It will be an enabler for me just because past few days I've learnt a lot about compilers. I will certainly be messing around with grammar.
I'll clean it up tomorrow.
I'll push operator precedence tomorrow.
This will be my magnum opus for a long time.

Good day, night.

# 2022-06-15

![Image](/ee21839185dd2ef87722f8e5b340f3bb.jpg)
*My IEMs are here*

![Image](/30e94995dc5ffff67f764d7cbe6a0fc9.jpg)
*Day 83 since recorded history, I am listening things on low volume. I can make out the details with my IEMs*

I had to break down the notes into even smaller chunks.
The grammar itself will span over 3 notes
- Literals
- Abstractions
- Applications

Good day, night

# 2022-06-14

Added assignment and multiline support.

I am cleaning it up right now and will write a series of notes
- Introduction to lambda calculus - grammar and lexer
- Making the AST
- Evaluating the AST

Running Emacs as daemon has made my life easier. No more longer load times.

# 2022-06-13

I DID IT!!! I made the compiler. The prototype is ready.

![Image](/0039a54e7ea7c4ffcad83c082905e785.png)

For now it can only execute single line and there's no assignment. I will add these over the coming days.

The next logical thing would be to look into combinators. My favorite is the `Y combinator` because that's how you implement recursion in lambda calculus.

My IEMs will arrive tomorrow, I am so excited.

Good day, night

# 2022-06-12

Spent the whole day reading about lexers and parsers. I have the grammar and lexer ready. I am using `nearley`. I should have the prototype ready tomorrow.

Also I found out Oracle cloud has free eligible arm machines with upto 12 core and 72 gigs of memory. I tried out 4core and 6gig config and it's way better than the micro instance which crashes under heavy workloads. I will test it out for the coming days.

[Toby Ho](https://youtube.com/channel/UCo3DTdFQphyjdnGy0xjLfZA) - one of the best resources on compiler 101.

I have so many "awesome" links. Soon I'll make a section on my site and call it `awesome`

![Image](/6cdb4f871a0deba0cb40420196c0227c.jpg)

Had an unexpected visit from an old friend, sweet.

Good day, night

# 2022-06-11

The reason I buzz my head is because it's one less thing to worry about. The plan is to reach to a state where I worry about very less things so I can truly focus on things which matter.

I was watching 6042 last night and I am hooked. I believe the most exciting field for me is logic because I use it everyday to solve problems.

I am going to watch `Dorian Gray`.

I am going to totally eliminate code with psudocode in the posts because translating idea into code is relatively easy once you get it and my time could be utilized somewhere else.

Tomorrow I am going to make a very tiny compiler.

# 2022-06-10

I like how [LowSpecGamer](https://youtube.com/c/LowSpecGamer) pivoted. He's been making some good content about tech industry.

I also like the fact that the lower bound of tech is increasing. I would totally be okay with an entry level GPU.

So 2D peak finding is just an extension of 1D peak finding.

# 2022-06-09

I started drinking milk again, thanks to chocolate syrups.

Today's plan is to write about peak finding and setup wireguard on vps.

1D Peak finding - check.

It'll take some time to setup wireguard.

Tomorrow it's 2D peak finding.

Night

# 2022-06-08

I have developed critical thinking so I can tackle almost any new problem. I wish I could've done it sooner, only if i could visualize math better.

I will be binging through 6006 - Introduction to algorithms to fill the gap.

Slimmed down my docker image and installed ruby. Smalltalk would've been fun but Ruby will work. I also need a functional language.

Had a vps messup. Jupyter was dockerized but my site wasn't. Dockerized it and good to go.

It was 2 things, first being `ufw` and second being caddy not serving static files.
Replacing ufw with firewalld solved it and for the second, serving by Hugo and reverse proxying fixed it.

I think I went through deployment hell. Altho there were no consequences It ate up my time.
I had planned to write about peak finding but oh well.

MIT OCW is a gem. I remember watching those about 2 years back. I did not have the fundamentals clear so I could only understand parts of it which lead to demotivation. I can do it now. The plan is to go through 6006 and then 6046. If there are any advanced courses than 6046 for algorithms I will go through them as well.

Good day, night

# 2022-06-07

So I found out `Redux` has grown a lot. `Redux toolkit` seems to eliminate a lot of boilerplate. But I found this out after spending a day on Redux.

Anyways I went through the docs and got upto speed. I pushed a redux primer along with jupyter notebook.
Binder is a good way to share notebooks. I even installed the javascript kernel so anyone reading my notebook can interact with the code.
Jupyter is one of the best environment.

The whole reason I did this was because I had been out of touch with redux. Tomorrow I will rapidly prototype.

I was busy with figuring out how to host it interactively. I tried a lot of options including `Google collab` but `Binder` works best for me.

There are quality small fragments I could write but it won't suit on the main page. Time to bring fragments back but not another repo. I'll keep it simple.

Good day, night

# 2022-06-06

Just learnt about Jupyter lab and its way better than notebook. Dockerized & hosted Jupyter lab.
Added vim extension on Jupyter lab.

This has to be the best dev environment, after smalltalk.

Peak finding had peaked my curiosity and I will explore it tomorrow.

One of the reasons I do write is to get upto speed asap. In this age I believe the best skill someone can have is the ability to learn quickly. Our brains are good at thinking not storing. Which reminds me I need to try org roam. One of the reason I haven't tried is it requires sqlite setup which means it might not work on multiple devices. I have to look into this before I commit.

Good day, night

# 2022-06-05

Biggest oof of the day, I was trying to reverse proxy without registering the subdomain. Yayyy. In my defense this is my first reverse proxy setup and I barely know anything.

Now I need to add jupyter as systemd service.

Services felt like arcane magic for me until now. After getting to know about systemd, the big picture of Linux reveals itself. I believe that was one of biggest part which I dint know the inner workings of.
Added jupyter as systemd service.

Jupyter has vim like keybinds, how cool is that?

Dockerized the whole setup. And It'll serve my literate programming needs better than org mode.
The biggest reason I dockerize something is reproducibility.

# 2022-06-04

I read about org roam today.

Started with Ruby koans. I can definitely see myself using it because it's objects all the way down

I need a refresher on redux. While I am at it, I'll write about rapid redux prototyping.
I can't do live programming with org mode.
I installed & hosted jupyter notebook with javascript kernel. So far really good. I want live programming. Lets see how this goes.

I have been very rusty with redux So I looked at it today and setup the javascript jupyter notebook.

I have so many ideas I can pair up with jupyter. The first is to get it running on my subdomain. I need to reverse proxy it. I'll debug it tomorrow.

# 2022-06-03

Recently during our conversations, we came across [Zettelkasten](https://eugeneyan.com/writing/note-taking-zettelkasten/#what-is-a-zettelkasten) system.

![Jun Zettelkasten setup](/jun_zel_setup.jpg)
*[Jun](https://arjun.lol/)'s Z setup*

Now that I've been pretty acquainted with org-mode, I can start making notes. I realize I do tinker around a lot of things but I don't write it down. So when I do go back, I have to backtrack from the beginning. I will be trying out org-roam for the coming days.

![Image](/1d911ae08bbc71bc60f71c388733d028.jpg)
*Stray release date announced*

One of the games I am really excited for. I know I'll like it when it's produced by Annapurna Interactive

For the past few days my prototyping language has been Ruby. Even with 0 knowledge I am able to prototype rapidly. Its about time I did Ruby koans.

I'll get comfortable with org roam

Tomorrow's plan is to tinker around org roam and zoom through Ruby koans

![Image](/fa5711aacc7e9f5bb22a8f4c45d2f5fd.jpg)

# 2022-06-02

0 config sftp is up. Although I don't have a use for now.

Plan for today
- [ ] Optimize site for mobile
- [x] Lookup basic seo files
- [x] Read mongodb manual

RTFM has proved to be the best guide

I skimmed through the mongodb manual. I learnt about the voting process if the primary node fails and I think its cool.
I like distributed systems. I believe distributed programming & distributed storage comes under distributed systems. I might be wrong but I like them all.

I think one of the reasons I do like distributed systems is the horizontal scaling part. The fact that you can scale a system with relatively low powered hardware is cool.

Writing about a solution helps me gain more clarity. Its me directing the reader with the right questions at the right time to understand the solution.

I need more clarity on Manacher's algorithm

# 2022-06-01

Todays plan is to push the two post in pipeline and read about concurrency.

Cronified builds.

![Image](/f79daed00e572ea3ea066092cd5f878d.jpg)
*Low effort CyberDeck*

Kadane's algorithm is out.

Running full fat Emacs on termux was slow, so I am using it on the vps. How cool is that, my own lil codespace.
I'll push Manacher's algorithm tomorrow.

Read about the actor model in concurrency and it's my favorite concurrency model. I won't code anything concurrent until I have very good knowledge about it.

# 2022-05-31

Just lost my changes by fucking around a detached head branch.

Your home made cicd, CRON.
I could utilize github actions to build & push to vps but I won't because I will do things without automation for a week and automate incrementally.

Fixed nav background on mobile. The color glitch out on firefox because of vendor css props. I'll just use postcss to even everything out.

Wrote about Kadane's algorithm for linear time subarray sum. Looked at
Manacher's algorithm for longest palindrome.

1 medium problem a day and a solution post is good enough. Tomorrow's plan is to integrate the artworks on site and cronify builds.

I looked at prolog today along with 99 problems in prolog. Logic programming has very elegant solutions and I like it.

# 2022-05-30

Dark mode with invert hack integrated.
Did some clean up as well. I need to do some more for mobile.
Todays plan is to host the site on vps. The biggest letdown will be cicd. I have automated build triggers on submodule push. I don't know how I'll achieve that on vps.

I have `next lexicographic permutation` in pipeline today.

Brainfucked myself with firewall rules with `firewalld`. For some reason 443 wasn't going through it. I switched to `ufw` and allowed all necessary ports and it worked. I can start migrating my site to vps.

I won't automate anything for now. Will run this scavenged setup for a while so I can appreciate abstractions.

I learnt a lot today. Hosted my first site from scratch. Although `caddy` made a lot of things easy, I will read about hosting for the coming days.

This will be my playground. I'll go from this scavenged setup to production docker-compose with caddy or nginx.

# 2022-05-29

I wrote a piece today. One is half done.
I feel like the code is redundant. Once idea has been passed, people can do it themselves. I'll soon move to psudocode

I got the Oracle free forever VPS. I'll setup hosting my website on it. If everything goes well, I'll setup a git instance as well. All of this using tailscale.

I don't see any point in having `fragments`. I'll merge it asap.

I tried some Ruby today. Its the closest thing to smalltalk. It has definitely peaked my curiosity and I know I'll be solving Ruby koans soon.

Recently Gopher came up in a conversation so I looked up other web protocols. I browsed gemini and gopher and I like the simplicity. I've always tried to go the other way. I don't need performance or fancy graphics. Thats why I use i3 and live in emacs. I'll look into porting my site to gemini and gopher. I'll be reading about them as well.

# 2022-05-28

I am totally skipping over shared memory model in concurrency. Its too tedious and I'll never use it IRL.

I did it. My magnum opus till now. [Generating Permutations](https://surajyadav.xyz/fragments/generate-permutations/).
Written & evaluated in `org-mode`. Socratic dialogue + first principles. I am very proud of myself.
I will continue writing.

I haven't been able to write because of less desk time. I ordered a wireless keyboard. Its about time I go mobile.
Its termux time.

Good day, night.

# 2022-05-27

So much to work on today

Todo
- [X] Remove word count and read time
- [X] Change footer
- [X] Increase font size
- [X] Copy assets to static script
- [X] Copy relevant files from theme and remove theme

Read about concurrency patterns. Concurrency is my new obsession. I'll mess around with go subroutines.

Setup tailscale today. I'll look into it more tomorrow.

Tomorrows plan is to write some literate programs in org mode & read about concurrency.

Good day, night.

# 2022-05-26

Spent the day migrating to hugo. Need to setup cicd.
Used [hugo-theme-mini](https://github.com/nodejh/hugo-theme-mini)
![Preview](https://rawgithubusercontent.com/nodejh/hugo-theme-mini/master/images/screenshot.png)

Once this is up, I can start writing with org-mode.

Good day, night.

Testing new site trigger from submodule update.
The new site didn't had the submodule push triggers. Added. Testing again.

IT WORKS!!!!!!!! AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA

Tomorrow, I'll fix the assets and it should be good to go.

# 2022-05-25

My leetcode practice & horizontal scaling obsession paid off. Fingers crossed.
I came across Bionic reading today. Its my new obsession. I installed a chrome extension so its on every page. I converted all my ebooks to bionic & sent to kindle. Been a while since I was this excited about reading.

I increased my font size on every system and my readability increased a lot.

I have been thinking about hugo because of its native support for org files. Let me think about this.

# 2022-05-24

I have been looking up to something.
I read abit about Hadoop today. I am very interested in horizontal scaling these days.

Good day

# 2022-05-23

Personal day.

# 2022-05-22

I binged Love, Death & Robots last night.

I played Transistor today. Its aesthetic. The art style and the little touches like the humming and the songs, this definitely makes in my top 10 list.

Today's plan is to solve some leetcode problems.

`It should be noted that no ethically-trained software engineer would ever consent to write a DestroyBaghdad procedure. Basic professional ethics would instead require him to write a DestroyCity procedure, to which Baghdad could be given as a parameter.`

# 2022-05-21

Migrated to use-package in emacs & started using mnemonics for keybinds like spacemacs.

Base system for org site is up. I'll port my site over the coming days.

Good day, night

# 2022-05-20

Personal day today.

Took a online assessment test. Pretty good in frontend.  Average in backend. The backend assessment had a lot of cryptographic security questions.

Tomorrow, I'll start publishing org-mode. The plan is to get the system up ASAP and then I can port my site slowly.

# 2022-05-19

I'll be reading about horizontal scaling today. System design is my new obsession.

# 2022-05-18

The sample fullstack app is ready.

I had the whole thing up & running on localhost & I thought about trying it on my phone and oops, it doesn't run since localhost no longer points to my pc running the backend. Hopefully, the people from docker discord server helped me out and I learnt that its out of scope of my task.

Random people from discord are way helpful than any person I've met. You post one issue and two of them spam you with solutions and encourage you to ask more questions. Nice people.
Here's the server [Docker Discord server](https://discord.gg/XwvrsZ6r)

# 2022-05-17

Finally was able to get Prisma working in docker.

And after that I wasn't able to access the db instance from internal network. Turns out I was trying to access on external port. This was the first time I am trying to setup a full stack app.

Tomorrow I should be able to be done with bulk of the problem. And then only finishing touches.

Good day, night

# 2022-05-16

I'll be messing around with Databases & its design for a while.

I am a beginner with database modelling. I could really improve there. I have decided to master psql and redis for now.

# 2022-05-15

Plan is to dockerize a fullstack sample app.
This evil & emacs combo is working very good. I don't want to switch my workflow to evil fully. I just want vim's powerful motions.
For the rest, emacs will do.

Integrating the backend is remaining in frontend.
Barebones backend is up.
DB needs to be implemented.
The whole thing is dockerized.

I tweaked which-key for faster response time. I still need a way to make which-key overlay on all the time. I'll be looking into it soon.

Good day, Night.

# 2022-05-14

I switched to `evil-mode`. The plan is to use evil-mode for editable buffers & emacs for read-only buffers.

I had my personal day.

# 2022-05-13

I wasn't able to complete the challenge but on the upside I can write programs literate style now.

![Image](/d312a0c721255e43827d273349806bcf.jpg)

# 2022-05-12

I made a small mistake of using JSON as storage, should've gone with sqlite. I can't serialize python datetime into jsonvalue.
I have to look into it.

Second, this is the first time I am using org-mode & literate programming for my development. I am still figuring out optimal ways to use it. I run snippets as well so the dev is iterative. I write a main program with the logical chunks-tags and then write those chunk tags in another block. But I want to test the chunk as well, so I write another block to test that code. If there are dependencies for a chunk, the get expanded as well so code is duplicated in the source file. I need to come up with a better solution for this so I can write my program as chunks, test them and the resulting source has no duplication.

All of this because I want to organize my program like a blog and instant feedback.

# 2022-05-11

Couldn't use my pc or wifi for 24 hours because the socket broke down.

Worked on the devops problem. Should be done by tomorrow.

# 2022-05-10

Started with a devops challenge, I am using literate programming for it and I am absolutely loving it. I am going in blind. Lets see if I can do this.

# 2022-05-09

Looked into noweb.

Occupied with personal stuff.

# 2022-05-08
I came across noweb for org-mode and I have fallen in love with it. It allows me to write separate chunks of code and include in other chunks. I can start writing literate programs now.

The other problem, more of an inconvenience is lack of support for org-mode for 11ty framework. I am looking into exporting my site to org-mode.

When I separate the code in chunks and prepend the required code for evaluation, the prepended code also shows up in export. The prepended code is duplicated so it shows up twice. Using the `:noweb strip-export` flag fixes it. This is turning out to be real good.

Nixos would be an overkill for me. Another alternative for me would be managing dotfiles using GNU Stow and flatpak everything (I don't know if it's possible).

I am diving deeper in literate programming. I came across Leo editor today and I'll check it out tomorrow

Good day, night

# 2022-05-07
Org-mode is very good. Good as in it can take over my life for documentation, programming and note taking.

I'll be moving towards org mode slowly.

Maybe in an year I can get really efficient with org-mode and migrate my site to it.

I wrote a literal program in org-mode today. I still need to figure out how to integrate it on my site because it uses markdown. There are some issues which need to be fixed for markdown export from org-mode.

Good day, night.

# 2022-05-06

I am just spamming recursion with memoization and I am loving it.

I got TLE(Time Limit Extended) on 2 medium Dynamic programming problems today. Need to think about optimization.

# 2022-05-05

Dynamic programming & org-mode it is today.

I haven't setup emacs as proper ide so I've been using vscode for leetcode.

It happened again, Leetcode passed Wrong answer verdict for a working solution. This has happened multiple time and its frustrating.

I'll be moving towards cpp for problem solving

I have familiarized myself with debugging and now I can't live without it. Right now, the only dynamic language with good debugging support is Python.

![Image](/85f74287984d72c156b421909461417b.jpg)

I need to figure out the layout I'll be using for literate programming.

Good day, Night

# 2022-05-04
Feel pretty comfortable with Linked lists & Doubly linked lists.
Recursion still seems to have downside with function call overhead. But I still prefer it over iterative solutions.

I have decided to publish the solutions as literate programming, using emacs `org-mode`

I'll be getting better at `org-mode` for the coming week.

Solved some more linked list & doubly linked list problems. Came across counting sort.

Tomorrow's plan is to solve some easy->medium dynamic programming problems.

# 2022-05-03
Solved a sliding hash problem.
Solved 2 more medium recursion problems.

I have decided to publish my leetcode solutions in fragments. I'll do that from tomorrow.

# 2022-05-02

Solved a linked list problem with 2 pointers. I am better off solving medium problems now.

![Image](/567adb1b5ddccd84b7228fa87394cd61.jpg)
I should've bought her home but her siblings were around.

One of the downsides of recursion is the hard limit languages have for recursive calls. Even if it's tail recursion.

Good day, Night

# 2022-05-01

Plan is to solve BST & Linked Lists today and look into bit masking.

![Image](/0a9b90f2a33b3be82eb38a49e7a356f8.jpg)
I'll be bald this whole summer, probably.

I conducted a survey with a sample size of 2, including me if the 1/6th sliced sandwich is too big and the results are
- Yes - 100
- No - 0
We really need to rethink about sandwich slicing.

Dint really solve any today.

Night

# 2022-04-30

Solved some Binary search & Linked List problems. The 14 day plan of Leetcode is locked, I can't access all of them at once.
I am very comfortable with Binary search now.
I will be doing BSTs and Linked lists tomorrow.
I am going to treat myself with icecream.

Leetcode still did that thing of passing Wrong Answer verdict for a working solution. I do not know what the issue is and I cannot do anything about it.

Solved some more of linked list. I missed recursion. Its back.

I feel I am ramping up with my problem solving skills. I don't wanna lose this momentum. Its been a while since I had this rush of problem solving. I want to continue doing this consistently.

Good day, Night

# 2022-04-29

Solved 2 problems in morning.
Something's wrong with leetcode. The submit test cases flag Wrong Answer(WA) but when I check on local, it gives me correct answer.
To verify it I ran the failing test case in leetcode's test cases and it gave correct answer but submission is flagging wrong answer.

I like memoization.

I saw The Mitchell's vs. The Machines, like the artstyle.

Solved some problems with Jun. Tried out other domains as well.

Good day

# 2022-04-28

Solved 3 problems so far. Good start for the day.

Been a while since I played dota. Imma play some today.

I am going to deep dry clean my keyboard today.

Solved 5 problems in total today. I am picking up basics of algo analysis.

Good day, Night

If it compiles, it works. Am I right? - *Some rust programmer*

![Image](/2f34c02994684b2cc351b079904cf163.jpg)

Leetcode is tough. I might have to take it at this pace, slow.

Solved 2 problems today. Good day.

Night

# 2022-04-26

I have to fight the compiler a lot with Rust.

Nope, rust is definitely not suitable for competitive programming for me.

Elegant code > everything.

I could only solve 1 problem today. While taking things slow is good but the languages feel inadequate. They don't support the verbs I want to work it. Something as simple as position-if function. I want these high order functions at my disposal.
I might have to build my own library.

Night

# 2022-04-25

I solved one more problem today. I'll ramp up as I go.
I am solving rustlings, will make rust my competitive programming language.

I have integrated asserts in my programming, poor mans tdd. I like it.

Speed is not my priority when it comes to problem solving, readability is.

# 2022-04-24

Tried out some easy leetcode problems and I really need to catchup.
I solved with python because it was the quickest to setup with tdd. I'll move on to cpp.

Spent some time looking into autotools.
I wrote an emacs babel function for evaluating python functions in org-mode.

I don't like language quirks. I want determinism. I don't want to spend an hour on abs function which gives segmentation fault.
I might have to try out rust or typescript.

Good day, Grind starts tomorrow.

# 2022-04-23

The amount of boilerplate in java is bonkers. I am ditching it. I'll use smalltalk.

Helped Xeon with his project, and the issue was Java's build system. I don't know why it has to be so complex.

I slept today. Tomorrow's my day off as well. Only reading.

[Your love is my drug](https://youtu.be/nWKPYs54INA)

Night

# 2022-04-22
I started with the TDD practice. I will finish the first exercise.

Coming monday Leetcode grind starts. I will fuck around my personal things until this weekend, from monday strict DSA.

I realized the testing things pretty easy if you are good at design, which smalltalk taught me.

Also [Dr. Ziltch](https://open.spotify.com/track/04RO1gAZbF34O2gv0Oak5U?si=lfdELlM0SgCfXZbESUv8Aw) slaps

I have been trying out the tdd in Javascript which doesn't really have good OOP support, It lacks some fundamentals. I am looking into Java, Java By Comparison - Pragmatic Bookshelf

Everything is just smalltalk & lisp. I don't need to learn the language, I just need to know its workflow, eg compilation, namespaces.

I'll look into Competitive programming books now. I'll setup the tdd setup with java tomorrow.

Came across yasnippets, I'll use and abuse it.

I'll get comfortable with Java tomorrow and start with some leetcode easy problems

Good day, night

# 2022-04-21

My cousin's here, we played Minecraft. I recommended him Portal, my first pc game.

I am not getting any pc time today, he's been playing Portal. I'll read.

![Image](/406a765d5812d69a243823ee1933f172.jpg)
*Test subject recruited*

I finished the Unit testing section. I can start tdd.

I started reading TDD by Example by Kent Beck. I am going to setup my TDD repo and fuck around some test cases.

From what I've read about Gnomes, it suits my character. But I'll look for other races as well, I don't care how niche it gets. I am pretty sure about class, Druid.

Good day, night.

# 2022-04-20

Whenever a merge error happens, my GitJournal breaks. It happened today and I couldn't write from phone.

I read today, a lot. I am halfway through the testing book. I also looked that `Players Handbook` for DND.
I like where I am headed as a dev. Docker then testing.

My cat is pregnant. Lets hope they make it this time.

My DND character is Aarakocra Druid, once he levels up he'll be able to fly. And he already has a power of transforming into any other form. I feel like this would be too much power. I'll rethink my character's race.

Here are some of the attributes I want my character to have
- lives in nature, around trees
- hungry for knowledge
- lone wolf
- 4-5ft tall, nimble
- lives over 500+ years
- can transform to any other form
- does whatever the fuck he likes, without worrying about consequences

I'll dedicate a piece to my character

Good day, I am having absolute blast playing Invoker.
Night

### Plan for today

# 2022-04-19

I know when I miss programming.

### Plan for today
- [ ] try some testing katas

I recently found out about Socratic Dialogue. And the reason its big for me is because the two books which had a big impact on me as a developer were written that way.
The Little Schemer & The Seasoned Schemer are written as Socratic dialogue.

I am going to read the 3rd book in the series The Reasoned Schemer, which is based on relational programming soon. I plan to read more of this style. Good stuff.

I will be reading a lot for a while.

I have been itching a lot to mess around with testing. Especially TDD. I am looking into it.

I started reading `Unit Testing: Principles, Practices & Patterns`. I really want to tinker with a good oop system but the only one which I like is smalltalk, nothing comes closer to the interactability of its IDE. I'll try it after testing for TDD.

Good day, I am getting good with Invoker.

Night

# 2022-04-18

I had the day for myself. I am going to write about my DND character and play some Divinity with Wolfie.

I also setup the vm I'll be testing on. Testing things on a VPS isn't the most ideal. Its just easy if its local.

# 2022-04-17

### Plan for today
  * [x] play lol/dota/rocket league
  * [ ] go through ahk docs

I pushed the Mobile phones post.

I have been playing as Oracle for a while, time to try out another hero. I want complexity, maybe Invoker.

I had a dream Last night, I was back in school and it was a drawing competition and I was drawing Paani puris.

I played Invoker. The number of playstyles this hero can pull off is insane. Plus the number of combos. I'll only play Invoker now.

I rewatched Blade Runner 2049. I am going to read about Brutalist architecture.

I am integrating this [fortune api](https://github.com/sarah256/fortune-api) on my site in diary section. Maybe not.

Invoker is fun.

I made my DND character today, It's an Aarakocra Druid. Me and Wolfie are going to play dnd soon.

Good day, Night

# 2022-04-16

### Plan for today
- [ ] dockerize repo mirror(postponed)
- [ ] push "My mobile phones till now"

I'll look into Autohotkey today.

Looks like I'll have to make my own image for hosting the mirror thing.

I'll have to move to trello or org-mode for managing things. This is getting out of hand. Plus I have been helping at home.

Every blocker comes back to linux administration. Like for today It was setting up ssh in docker. I know, a bit meta maybe. I need to take a step back & rethink.

I am taking a break tomorrow. Its editing & drawing maybe. And I'll play League with Wolfie.

The Mobile phones piece is half done. I'll finish it tomorrow.

Night

# 2022-04-15

### Plan for today
  * [x] mirror a repo with ansible & cron it

Played dota after a long time. I need a singleplayer now.

I noticed the two task I plan for the day need to be related. I'll keep that mind. I suppose I could edit & draw on Sundays.

I successfully mirrored my repos to bitbucket with ansible. Now to cronify it.
Added the mirroring playbook to cron. I'll check it at night if its working.

I might have overengineered the mirroring thing. Eh, if it works it'll payoff.

For some reason I can't set the python version for ansible. Tomorrow I'll dockerize & see if it works. The mirroring works fine on local with python3.8 But I am not able to set the specific version for ansible on vps.
Dockerizing should solve it.

Tomorrow I'll push a fragment about the phones I used. Its going to be good 😁.

Night

# 2022-04-14

### Plan for today
- [x] setup and tinker vps
- [ ] make Emacs artwork

There's no link styling on my site. I'll fix it today.

I liked playing as Brim in Valorant. I'll draw his Stim Beacon soon.

I'll soon setup a cyberdeck with termux.
Something like this
![Image](/03725bccf6bc61b9eccdac7b6a7522f9.jpg)
*Credit - https://sixohthree.com/termux-for-android*

I haven't been able to get a lot of time on my desk. I really need a portable solution. Once I setup the vps I should be good to go with a ssh client.

I am looking into how to read man pages efficiently. I can write "Your best friends on the CLI".

I like determinism. I will be tinkering with ansible for the coming week. The first problem that I want to solve is mirroring my github repos on bitbucket with ansible. This will be a good exercise to learn ansible & to solve my problem.

Testing pushing from vps, success.

I setup ansible successfully. Now onto playbooks.
I did it. I cloned a repo using ansible. Small victory.

Tomorrow if I am able to mirror 1 repo, I'll call that a win.

Good day, I like the fact that I am moving towards devops. I'll be one man army.

Night

# 2022-04-13

### Plan for today
- [x] make 2 docker containers communicate(calling it done)
- [x] watch/read Linux administration

How do you even steer a train? I'll get to the bottom of this today.

Good train channel, Lesics

I set up the networking & assigned static ips to docker containers but to use those ips I need to set environment variables. I am not able to setup environment variables in create-react-app and digging into it is just not worth it.
I call this mission accomplished.

Time to focus on linux administration.

Just learnt I can use service name instead of assigning static ips to containers.

Linux administration is very vast so I have decided to constrain myself to practices.
  * user management
  * service management
  * process management
  * authentication

My progress as a dev
  * [x] \*nix
  * [x] smalltalk
  * [x] lisp
  * [x] containerization(docker)
  * [ ] distributed computing(elixir/erlang)

Finally added checkboxes to my site, looks good.

This style of keeping track is not efficient. I need to start using kanban. I have noticed there 1 big task & a small one which I do get done, I need to start planning considering that.

I'll soon tinker around with elixir.
One of the aspects where I can improve a lot is testing. This is very overlooked and it really pays off in the long run. I am going to setup a tdd lab and fuck around until I get comfortable.

Nasty thing happened, ref lock thing on my git repo. I am making backup repos now.

Got a GCP vps, lets try some shit.

Night

# 2022-04-12

### Plan for today
- [x] read docker cookbook
- [ ] look into Linux administration
- [ ] edit video

I'll read about terraform today.

I tried using emacs as my window manager, din't work out because
  * had to manually send keys
  * would freeze up sometimes and had to reboot
I realized I am better off with i3wm. I'll soon go through all the docs of i3 and rice it up, not that I haven't. But I'll be more comfortable tweaking it if I know everything.

Just noticed text isn't wrapping on my site, will fix it asap

I need to test out multiple docker containers & docker compose. I'll just grab template repos & test.

My reading list at night
  * https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/concept-evil/
  * https://iep.utm.edu/moral-re/#:~:text=Moral%20relativism%20is%20the%20view,uniquely%20privileged%20over%20all%20others

I am not sleeping without docker composing the template fullstack app.

docker-compose is wayyy too powerful, I like it.

I composed them together. Now I need to make them talk to each other.

![Image](/a1e1f6660ddceb55e12338623f7acea1.jpg)

I am going to finish watching Puss in Boots and then solve the docker thing

I'll look into it tomorrow

Night friend

# 2022-04-11

My legs sore and painful from all the cycling.

Busy with home stuff today. I'll dockerize my portfolio jut for fun today.

![Image](/1fe105dcb9d332cd75e1765e6d7b7f76.jpg)

### Plan for today
- [x] dockerize portfolio

Dockerized.
I feel like I can augment `make` but this'll work for now.

What else can I do?
  * one click deployment
  * one click dev spin up

I mean theres not much to it, but I can use my portfolio to test it.

Came across my first hurdle, hot reloading. Lets figure that out.
Will be solved with volume mapping.

One of the reasons I am really good at my art is automation. If I ever notice repeating myself, I automate it.

Mapping the volume enables hot reloading, yayyyyy, EZ.

I am using make file for now, It should do the job. I'll use docker-compose.yml when the need arises. Plus I wanna use makefiles, I want to integrate them in my workflow.

I really need to edit my videos. I will edit them for the coming days along with tinkering with docker.

Actually good day considering I worked relatively less than usual but got more done.

Night friend

# 2022-04-10

### Plan for today
- [ ] dockerize something, anything

Have been browsing a lot of r/fuckcars. I have a craving for reading about city design.

I'll be making my own home gym.

My wifi has been down since afternoon. I'll just read Docker cookbook today.

I am really excited about Mumbai Metro. Soon I will take my bike along in Metro to meet with the Bois.

Couldn't really dockerize, I'll do it tomorrow.

Very tired due to workout.

Night friend

# 2022-04-09

### Plan for today
- [x] chill and fuck around docker

`The more we pursue the idea
of programs as literature, the better our programs become.` - *Some wise literate programmer*


It was a blast. One of the best time with the Bois.
I am tired, I'll look into docker when I wake up.

Somehow chrome seems to freeze exwm. I am switching to firefox permanently.

Me and Akshit played some Rocket League. Rumble & Hockey modes are cool.

I remapped application launcher on Super+Space and this is wayyyyyyyyy better.
I read some of `Docker cookbook` today. I'll be tinkering with docker playground tomorrow.

Good day, Night friend

# 2022-04-08

### Plan for today
- [ ] Setup desktop-environment, polybar & dunst(postponed)
- [ ] Make emacs artworks

I'll edit the video once I have my desktop setup.
I'll soon switch to nix or guix so this week will be spent experimenting.

Emacs artworks it is today.

I figured executing ssh-add persists until reboot. So I execute it once after every startup now.

Been having eyestrain past these days, gonna go get my eyes checked.

Got myself some glasses with the shades thingy, EZ.

Docker starts tomorrow, no matter what.

The current exwm setup feels sufficient. I don't have a system tray but I don't miss it.
I have decided to continue using it for now and rice it when I feel the need for.

I'll try to setup docker playground now.
Tried docker, it feels pretty easy. Its just linux with some automation.
I'll deep dive now.

I got my glasses and OMG it feels so trippy. Everythings so clear.
Idk how I managed until now. I wanna go to places just to see things this clear.

I can see things on my pc from bed. This power... its too much. I have a fucking scope.

I looked more into docker, it feels just linux. Thats it.
Shouldn't be hard to master it.

Just enabled `ivy-rich` and it made my life even better. Gives the docstring of entities.

Good day, i ll try to get comfortable with docker asap.

My eyes feel ticklish and watery, it ll be fine after they get used to glasses.

Couldn't draw Emacs because spent the whole day in Linux.

Tomorrow I'll push the `My favorite Emacs packages` article.

I am going to attend the convocation of the Bois. Its party time. EZ.

Night friend.

# 2022-04-07

### Plan for today
- [ ] Edit 2nd chunk with Davinci
- [x] Rice up my exwm

Honestly I feel like I've gotten myself comfortable with Davinci's workflow.
Thats why I've been putting off editing the other chunks with something else.
I'll edit the 2nd part today.
Any other video I make, I'll edit it with something else.

I am missing essentials from exwm like bar and applets. I'll add them today.

I came across `golden ratio` emacs package. This is gold. Automatically resizes the focused window.
Fragments worthy.

I recently switched to firefox and it feels snappy. Snappier than Chrome.

For essentials, system tray is left in exwm. For some reason exwm-systray isn't available. I'll have to use something else

System tray not available. I ll setup polybar tomorrow.

Easy day. Night friend

# 2022-04-06

### Plan for today
- [x] Configure exwm
- [ ] Edit with Kdenlive

I noticed I haven't been using emacs a lot for the past few days.
And that changes today, I am installing exwm and making it my default window manager.
Its everything emacs baby.

Installed evil-mode. Best of both worlds. Since I am comfortable with emacs and I like vim's keybinds, this setup is comfortable
than grabbing a distribution.

I'll spend the day today configuring exwm and evil keybinds.

Exwm with evil mode turned out to be a bit of hassle, my browser windows turn read only. This is something I'll look into later on.
Vanilla emacs exwm it is for me for now.

I looked up about `ssh-add` persistence and I came across `ssh-add -K /path/to/key`. Lets see if this works.
It did prompt me once. Let me try again. Nope, no luck.

Figured out how to show the command keybind in minibuffer completion. One of the best things.
Added it in fragments. ezpz.

Need to setup gif recordings & add assets from fragments.

One of these days I'll make an emacs artwork.

# 2022-04-05

### Plan for today
- [ ] Edit with Kdenlive
- [x] Add `fragments`

I'll take a look at Davinci Resolve fusion nodes today.
I might try NixOS in a VM. The documentation is very good.

I tried out clojure today. It feels like it has more support due to being on JVM, but thats just how I feel.
One of the biggest reason I haven't gotten really good at lisp is lack of documentation & discoverability.
I want an emacs package which'll list out all the packages, functions, classes and let me browse through just like any smalltalk implementation.

I skimmed through fusion nodes. It seems like I can use frequently used effects as nodes. I'll look into it soon.

Added base `fragments`. This will work for now. Since I have fragments up and running now would be a good time
to look for a good git android app. Fragments can be anything which doesn't belong in diary or worth calling a good piece, its like youtube shorts or a 1 man twitter.

Tomorrow, I edit my 2nd video with Kdenlive. I'll lookup some basic seo as well.

Calling it a day, Night friend

# 2022-04-04

Davinci Resolve is taking too much time. Jun recommended to chunk it so I can experiment with
- other editing programs
- editing styles

### Plan for today
- [x] Release first chunk of `Solving Clojure Koans`

First video is out, yayyyyy.

I have a purpose now. Puzzle life and the biggest puzzle is my life.

I'll make the portal companion cube artwork and make it as my channel logo.

Since I have one content for `shorts`, I can start working on it today.

I am not calling it `shorts`, its `fragments`.

I want an electric bicycle. I'll buy it next year.

I finally made the companion cube. This will be my official logo everywhere now.
![Companion Cube](https://rawgithubusercontent.com/jarusll/artworks/main/companion_cube/cube.svg)

I finished watching `The way of the househusband`, pretty wholesome. I'll read the manga now

Instead of figuring things out how to filter, I'll just push `fragments` for now. I'll manage filtering later on. So I can finish base implementation tomorrow.

I'll push the videos every alternate days so I can get comfortable with an editor in a day and push the video next day.

From what I've read Latin feels like the lisp of languages. I might give it a try.

Night friend.

# 2022-04-03

finished clojurescript koans first thing in the morning.

### Plan for today
- [ ] come up with a design for shorts
- [x] edit clojurescript koans videos

I need to start making realistic plans. Looking back I am not able to finish everything I plan for. I'll be easing it now.
In a day, I am only able to do one big task. So I'll just plan a semi big task for a day.

I have been using mechvibes since yesterday. Its cool. https://mechvibes.com. I like the sound of Blacks. Blues have this springy tone at the end
and its annoying.

I forgot to delete my lightsail instances and I've been charged for 3 months now. I did disable the instance.

Things I need to do for the edit
- Line up the videos
- Transitions(maybe)
- Background music(lofi chill)
- Color grading(warm and low contrast)

There is just too much to learn about video editing. I will give this a day more.
I am blurring things out right now. I am yet to add text banners. Commentary is out of the question.

Editing is a bitch. I did an amateur of not doing things in incognito and I now have to blur things out. AAAAAAAAAAAA

I have the videos lined up & blurred out whatever needed to be.
I am going to take a break. I'll add the text banners now and it should be good to go.

I am calling it a day. I'll finish editing it tomorrow.

Night friend.

# 2022-04-02

### Plan for today
- [ ] setup `shorts` on portfolio
- [ ] record screencast of solving clojure koans at http://clojurescriptkoans.com
- [ ] watch some linear video editing
- [x] play dota with the bois, been a while since I played(played lol)

I'll read some short stories today.
One of these days need to think about seamless images integration on portfolio. I can add image in diary but they get added in diary repo, that directory hasn't been configured for images. There will be more resources directories in future. Need a futureproof(enough) solution.

Next week I'll setup RSS for my portfolio.

![My Setup](/45c1d0ac5c158dbe491e518249607dc5.jpg)
*My Setup*

Testing image.
Needs to be prefixed by `/images/`. Testing again.
Works.

Images can be easily added by passthrough copy in 11ty. The raw images uploaded from phone would be unoptimized but this will suffice for now.

I am still yet to design the setup for shorts. Since there will be lots of posts, I will need filtering.

Halfway through clojure koans.
Once I have a stable recording setup I can start recording other things.

# 2022-04-01

### Plan for today
- [x] look into org mode
- [x] fuck around github copilot

I'll start applying for jobs soon.

I love github copilot. No, it won't make people lose their jobs, it'll help them grow as a dev.
One of the things will be sensible names when they try to use copilot suggestions. For me it'll be generating boilerplate, discoverability(with caution)
and automating trivial things. I will decompose my problem more and thus improve my code quality.

I have made a Point class library for fun. That library can have some more functions if I had Angle class. I will be making the Angle class
 with the help of github copilot. Lets see how this goes.

Looks like there's no pornhub comments api, just scraping solutions.

https://game.postdoesnotexist.com/ - Good game

`faces` are typefaces in emacs. Can customize to my liking.

I was thinking about making a `shorts` section on my site. There are things which shouldn't go in my diary but shorts.

Tomorrow I will be working on shorts section. I was also planning on doing screencasts. Maybe I can combine both of these in one section. They will be fragments of cool things which don't belong in my diary.

Night friend.

# 2022-03-31

### Plan for today
- [x] finish elisp koans
- [ ] draw portal companion cube

Have been looking into guix, this is definitely something I'll look into someday.

I feel like I have familiarized myself with emacs well to move around quick enough. Next plan would be to setting custom keybinds.

Emacs has a diary. I looked into it. My current setup works for now given that I push from my phone as well.

All this time I have been on a scavenged linux setup. I picked the first obvious solution & stuck to it. I really want to craft a system and stick to it.
The setup will be
- minimal
- stable
- deterministic

I haven't looked at guix yet but scheme as config language does seem appealing to me plus its something new so fun.

I read some of "One more thing: stories & other stories". Good short stories.

I looked at nixos, I like the idea. Now I need to find out & justify if it works for me.

I finished the koans, there are 2 koans but they are exercise. I might do them if I feel like it. Right now, I have to digest some elisp. I'll come back to these after a day or two.

Haven't been able to do a lot these days because I have been helping at home. If it becomes extreme I might look for a laptop or travel keyboard so I can work from phone.

Good day, night friend.

# 2022-03-30

### Plan for today
- [ ] finish elisp koans
- [x] setup krita/libresprite for drawing

Easy day, woke up late. Need to fix my sleep schedule. I wish I can get back my lost sleep but that's not possible.

I'll draw the portal companion cube today.

One of these days need to think about seo. It feels spammy and unethical. I'll keep it clean.

Found out a really sweet [Clojure Koans website](http://clojurescriptkoans.com/). Will give it a try soon.

Helped out Xeon with his assignment today. Java isn't that bad. I'll give it a try someday.

`"CL (and elisp!) provides the programmer with more than enough rope to hang themself."` - *elisp-koans*

I like introspection. Thats one of the big reasons I like emacs & smalltalk.

# 2022-03-29

### Plan for today
- [x] figure out data sources for d2newspaper
- [ ] do elisp koans
- [x] watch system crafters

Came across `elcord-mode`, discord rich presence for emacs. Looks cool.
`recentf-mode`, remembers all the recent files. I am using it now.

Just found out about `describe-symbol` in emacs. It gives documentation about elisp symbols.

One thing that I really want to master in emacs is motions, moving around in buffer fast, really fast. Thats the thing I liked about Vim a lot. If I can make it happen here, I won't need any vi emulation modes.

One of these days I'll draw the portal companion cube artwork. I got one online but it seems unethical. I'll make my own.

Seems like `ssh-add` doesn't persist. I don't know how long but it doesn't. I am trying out `git config credential.helper store`. Lets see if this works.

I know just enough about elisp so that I can read the manual & get stuff done.
Also the credential helper thing doesn't store any ssh keys. I'll have to look into it soon.

Found out `which-key`, It lists all the commands available in current mode.
Here's a preview from ![justbur/emacs-which-key](https://github.com/justbur/emacs-which-key/raw/master/img/which-key-bottom.png)
This is very helpful. I can just scroll through the commands to see what action I want, It shows the keybind as well. After a while it'll become second nature.

Me and Wolfie figured out how to get all the data for d2newspaper. We'll be using jq to filter out. Should be easy. ezpz.

Holy shit `which-key` is fucking awesome. If I enable `which-key-mode`, I can type out Key combinations and wait for the suggestions. This is exactly what I was looking for.

Actually good day, learnt a lot about Emacs. Day rating - 6/10. Tomorrow I'll try to finish elisp-koans.
Ez, night friend

# 2022-03-28

### Plan for today
- [x] setup `D2Newspaper`
- [x] fix posts github script
- [ ] setup git on android

The mount is here. Power tools are scary.
I have enough desk space now, I can use my drawing tablet.
I set it up everything. I ll play Far Changing Tides, I've earned it.

I'll be messing around with emacs lisp for a while. My goal is to start talking in terms of emacs objects like buffers, windows & frames and then write some trivial macros.

Man I love magit, I am quickly able to do git actions which is letting me make rapid small changes. Good stuff.

I'll be trying out [elisp koans](https://github.com/jtmoulia/elisp-koans)
I did some elisp koans. I expected emacs types but this is standard lisp stuff.
Anyways the youtube series by System Crafters should get me upto speed with emacs types.

I wanted to open my diary file quickly, I came across emacs registers. You can store any thing, good stuff. I stored my diary file at d. So I can access it by `C-x r j d` from anywhere in emacs. ezpz.

Easy day, pushed "What motivates me", started with elisp. System crafters should get me upto speed with Emacs.

Planned about d2newspaper. Lets make this happen.

Night friend

# 2022-03-27

### Plan for today
- [ ] setup `D2Newspaper`

There's a lot of dust buildup in my pc, need to clean it. I ll do it when the mount arrives.

Wolfie talked about how he's missing reading books and now I want to read🥺. I will gain momentum first with short reads.

Pushed draft of "What motivates me"

Now that everything has been automated and decoupled, I can write articles on my phone. Need to find a good git app for Android.

Wolfie busy, we ll setup tomorrow.

Just realized I have misconfigured GitHub actions for posts and no listener for posts_push on portfolio. Will fix it tomorrow.

Day rating - 5/10. My eyes were strained and I lost all dota matches

# 2022-03-26

### Plan for today
- [x] add site build trigger on `posts` push
- [x] integrate artworks
- [ ] push `why i like smalltalk - message protocols`
- [ ] add `` markdown highlights

Holy shit webp is good.
Just found out I can add ssh keys and I won't have to input password. VERY BIG, love it, my life is easy.

Its been a while since I had any day off, tomorrow is my day. No work tomorrow. I ll play dota and draw.

`The Green Knight` was the last decent movie I saw. I might watch some `Monty Python`.

Me and Wolfie discussed about the Destiny thing(`D2Newspaper` for now). I'll be working on it with him.

# 2022-03-25
Like LoL characters, but the game feels like a mobile game. Might give it one more try.

### Plan for today
- [x] integrate diary
- [ ] push `why i like smalltalk - message protocols`
- [x] think about artworks integration
- [ ] plan for destiny thing with Wolfie

Man i love playing Oracle

I have my `posts` repo as gitsubmodule in `portfolio` repo and whenever I make a change in posts, I have to commit it twice, once in `post` & once in `portfolio`.
I just want to commit once and be done

Integrated Dark mode, ezpz

One of these days, need to plan about decoupling the submodules and building the site on push of any dependency repos

Oh hello git submodules

I did it, ahahah. I am a fucking god. I successfully tested GitHub actions trigger on push in submodule repo.

Lets see if this works.

Yes it does, ahahahahahahaah.

Automated site build on submodule push. I did it for diary so I can write from phone, push and everything will just work. Tomorrow I'll do the same for posts

Good day, night friend

# 2022-03-24

Hello friend

24th November

`Just let it crash and drop in debugger, we'll define things on the fly` - *Some wise smalltalk programmer*

Easy day, dint really get much done. Pushed "Why I made a public diary" and made the diary.

Need to clone the diary repo in GitHub workflow.
