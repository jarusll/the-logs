You can officially finger my server by `finger -l jarusll@suraj.lol`.

I have been playing alot of Indie games. Recently I finished
- `Cloud Climber` - A game about end of humanity. You play as a character(probably the last person on earth) looking for resources on sky high wood towers.
- `Socrated Jones: Pro Philosopher` - A detective style game where you debate in your afterlife with prominent philosophers about Morality for getting back to earth.

and a couple more indie puzzles like `Frame of mind`, `Shadow Burglar`. I got these list from the curated list `Gamers with very less time`. I've played quite a few of the listed titles.

I finished playing this cute short game `Dr Langeskov, the tiger and the terribly cursed emrald`. Its about game development. You help the developer setup scenes for the game that you intended to play. Very meta, cute, recommended. `The Stanley Parable` is along the same lines. I've played it before but I am trying to find new endings in this playthrough. I like the kinds of game I can be away for a month and jump back in without losing the story.

Hello from my git home server, I truncated this repo and migrated it to my home server so it acts as intermediary between me and GitHub.

I came across `Restart Frame` for debugging and I am totally going to overuse it. I learnt about it when I was looking for reverse debugging for JS. I want to try live programming with debugging.

I have an interactive repl setup where I send snippets to repl directly from vscode. I am using [Send to Terminal+](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ivoh.sendtoterminalplus)

I attended IndiaFOSS 3.0 at Bangalore with Jun. The ones that really added alot of value for me were the following ones
- [What I learnt by building Vyaakaran to make learning fun](https://indiafoss.net/2023/confirmed/d4febde6a4) by Akash Hamirwasia

  Because I was tinkering with making a language(beginners lisp) and the visualization would've helped alot

- [The Political Roots of AI Policy: Or Why Debiasing Is A Misleading Solution](https://indiafoss.net/2023/confirmed/ad58511227) by Anupam Guha

I started reading `Beginning x64 Assembly Programming` by `Joe Van Hoey`. Its been fun playing around with `gdb` and getting to know the low level stuff. Prime example `syscalls`, `stack pointers`, `base pointers`. It fills missing info as a programmer about the stack, heap and more things. I am looking forward to `SIMD`. My goal out of this would be to have a clearer understanding of the hardware and hopefully this'll help me reason about things for optimization.
